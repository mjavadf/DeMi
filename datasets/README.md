**Social Condition and Integration of Foreign Citizens**: In 2011-2012 Istat conducted the first national sample survey on “Social Condition and Integration of Foreign Citizens” (SCIF). The SCIF survey aims at providing information on many features of socio-economic integration of migrants in Italy for a better understanding of resident foreign population. The sampling unit is the household with at least one component with foreign citizenship resident in Italy. In the SCIF survey, foreign citizens are identified by citizenship, not by the place of birth. Face-to-Face interviews have been conducted by CAPI technique (Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing), on a sample of 9,553 households, for a total of 20,379 individuals with foreign citizenship. The survey data provides a framework on characteristics, behaviors, attitudes and opinions of the foreign citizens resident in Italy. Several aspects are detected: family composition, education, migratory path, employment status, discrimination, health conditions and accessibility of health services, migrant integration, citizen's security and victimization, housing conditions. The survey is included in the National Statistical Programme (NSP) which gathers the statistical investigations needed for the Country.
